				<p>"Good gawd! Matt has feet of gold! Will you marry me?? 

				Call me crazy, but I enjoy massages that hurt-so-good and are actually productive! Don't get me wrong, there's a time and a place for a soft, gentle rub down. Hell, I have friends that can provide that to me for free. It doesn't require nearly as much skill or intuition as I encountered with Matt last night. Now I'm sure the peeps at Happy Endings can accommodate you fragile flowers too, but personally, when I'm super stressed out or physically in pain, I want my massage to yield results and remedy those ailments! This was my first time having an Ashiatsu massage and the combination of gravity working in my favor, paired with Matt's amazing technique, was pure bliss! I literally felt high when I walked out of that place. 

				I'll be back and definitely recommend this place to any and everyone. Treat yourself. You'll be happy you did! :)"<br><br>~ Amanda Huggenkiss</p>
